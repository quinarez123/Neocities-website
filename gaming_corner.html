    <p>I'm still enjoying the game immensely, but it's getting harder. My hospital keeps going broke. After you learn
      the mechanics, you start to optimize and that is also fun. Will probably keeps playing until I get bored or something.
      If any of you have any recommendations leave them here so I can play them. Oh wait how would you do that? Damn, that's
      tough.

    <p>This games is pretty good where you are in charge of a hospital and
      you have to train your staff and cure people. I highly recommend.

    <p><strong>Update: </strong>Alright not gonna lie, this game is pretty addicting, I played like 14
    and a half hours the last two days. I sucked in the beginning but I'm getting better. I'm obsessed</p>
