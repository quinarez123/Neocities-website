    <p>Another game from Humble Bundle. This is a JRPG where you find and recruit 100 players. Yes that's right. 100
      There's alot of talking in the beggining of the game but that's pretty common in JRPGs. The main attraction is the
      other characters writing. They're pretty fun. I'm going to play just to see what's up but I'm not expecting much

    <p>I had to drop this game, it was making me way too naseous. Rarely do I get motion sickness from video games
      but this one had me feeling sick from playing around 10 minutes. It's a shame because it seemed like a fun game.
      Oh Well!

    <p>Alright readers, The game that I am currently playing is Warhammer Boltgun. It's a boomer shooter set in the Warhammer 40K universe. Not the biggest 40K fan but
      I got this game through humble bundle so I'm giving it a try. I've always liked boomer shooters so hopefully I like it. There's a big negative though. As I played
      through the game yesterday, I started to get some motion sickness. I'm going to keep trying to play it but if it still makes me sick I'm going to stop

    <p>Yea the game was way too long. I had fun but I feel it's time to retire the game. Readers if you are still thinking about getting the game do it now!!. Just know
      if you get tired of a game, even if you love it, it's okay to retire it. There are two other games in the series, Two Point Campus, where you manage a university and
      Two Point Museum where you are the curator of a museum. I can't wait to try them out but i think I'm going to take a break from the series.

    <p>I'm still enjoying the game immensely, but it's getting harder. My hospital keeps going broke. After you learn
      the mechanics, you start to optimize and that is also fun. Will probably keeps playing until I get bored or something.
      If any of you have any recommendations leave them here so I can play them. Oh wait how would you do that? Damn, that's
      tough.

    <p>This games is pretty good where you are in charge of a hospital and
      you have to train your staff and cure people. I highly recommend.

    and a half hours the last two days. I sucked in the beginning but I'm getting better. I'm obsessed</p>
